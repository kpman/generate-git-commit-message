Here are my code changes:
{clipboard}

Please use the content enclosed within the following three backticks as context to generate a conventional git commit message:
```
<type>(<site>/<optional scope>): <description>

<optional body>
```

<site> variable comes from file paths like sites/xxx/ooo, where xxx is the site variable to replace
commit message.
The optional body should be less than 3 bullet points.
The optional body should has one empty line after commit message header.
The commit message header should less than 70 characters.
The commit message should not include the three backticks.

For example:

chore(zoo/locale): add expense component locale
- Implement search by issue identifiers, issue titles, or usernames in notifications
- Remove console.log from getNotificationTitle function
- Enhance notification item display with additional keywords for search

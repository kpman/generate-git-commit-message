Here are my code changes:
{clipboard}

Please generate one conventional git commit message with the following structure:
"""
<type>(<site>/<optional scope>): <description>

<optional body>
"""

<site> variable comes from file paths like sites/xxx/ooo, where xxx is the site variable to replace
commit message.
The optional body should be less than 3 bullet points.
The optional body should has one empty line after commit message header.
The commit message header should less than 70 characters.

For example:
===
chore(zoo/locale): add expense component locale
- Implement search by issue identifiers, issue titles, or usernames in notifications
- Remove console.log from getNotificationTitle function
- Enhance notification item display with additional keywords for search
